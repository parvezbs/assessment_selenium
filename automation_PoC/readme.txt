This is a selenium automation PoC. This contains a simple wrapper of business functionality over the selenium's code methods to fulfill the automate web application actions. This is very simple automation suite enables a user to start writing test cases in an organized way. Here I'm using the TESTNG framework to organize, prioritize and report the tests.

Also, MVN being the project management tool, this suite provides a clear and layered distinguish ion between business logic core functionality of the function abnd test cases which enables user to read clearrly through the methods, code and test cases. Also, that gives user an opportunity to re-use and extend the methods with minimum re-write.

Simple steps to run:
Download whole project and open command prompt and run below command:

java -jar automation_assignment.jar

It will do the automated test cases execution and the results will be published to test-output directory.

Let me know your thoughts.
